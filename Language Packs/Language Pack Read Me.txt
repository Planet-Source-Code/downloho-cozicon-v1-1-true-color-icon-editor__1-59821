CozIcon Language Pack Spec's

How it works:
   By matching the actual Visual Basic control's and form's name it will try and set it's caption or text.


The 'Form' must be set first because any control following will be associated with said form.

Example:

Form=Form1
Command1=Hello
Command2=World

One pack can manipulate multiple Forms in the same fashion:

Form=Form1
Command1=Hello
Command2=World
Form=Form2
Command1=Goodbye
Command2=World

You may also assign the controls' FontName and FontSize:

Form=Form1
FontName=Arial
FontSize=14
Command1=Hello
Command2=World


Within Visual Basic You need only three(3) Functions to execute this feature:

  Public Function FindObject(ByRef frm As Form, ByVal ControlName As String) As Object
  Public Function FindWindow(ByRef FormName As String) As Form
  Public Function LoadLanguage(ByVal FileName As String)


FindObject - Checks the form 'frm' for every control against 'ControlName' and returns the object.
FindWindow - Checks every loaded form against 'FormName' and returns the form's object.
LoadLangage - Will load the specified 'FileName'. It references FindObject and FindWindow functions.
