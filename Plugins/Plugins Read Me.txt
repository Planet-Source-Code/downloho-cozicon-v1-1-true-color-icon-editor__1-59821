*** Plugins ***



CozIcon plugin system uses compiled programs(*.exe) for it's plugins.

CozIcon will executed any program located in Plugins directory (it's important that you only download plugins from trusted websites!) and it will set it's command to load a copy of the current icon. The program should load the file, manipulate it and then let CozIcon know that it's finished(via SendMessage and SetText Api's).

Please refer to the Example Plugin for Visual Basic source of a plugin.
